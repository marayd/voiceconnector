# 🎙️ Unite the Voice Chat Communities: PlasmoVoice ↔ SimpleVoiceChat Plugin

There's been a long-standing debate in the community over which voice chat mod is superior — **PlasmoVoice** or **SimpleVoiceChat**.

It's time to put that argument to rest.

I’ve developed a plugin that bridges the gap between the two, allowing players using **PlasmoVoice** to hear players using **SimpleVoiceChat**, and vice versa.

With this plugin, there's no need to choose sides. Just add the plugin to your server, and players from both communities can communicate freely — no extra configuration required!

## ✅ Features
- Seamless cross-mod voice communication
- Plug-and-play installation
- Compatible with both **PlasmoVoice** and **SimpleVoiceChat**
- Unites your player base, regardless of voice mod preference

## 🚀 Installation
1. Download the plugin.
2. Drop it into your server’s `plugins` folder.
3. Restart your server.

That’s it — you’re done!

Let’s bring the voice chat communities together. 💬❤️
